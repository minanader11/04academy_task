Dear 04Academy, 
I have some notes on design and apis,some of post api's body requires some parameters that doesn't appear on the design and some of textfields in design doesn't exist in the body of api , the arabic response of api gives me a strange characters (i don't know if it happens to me only or not) , I have tried to implement the ui to look like the video as mush as i could.


Total time spent: 10 hours.
