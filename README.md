Dear 04Academy, 
Notes on Design and API Implementation
Design and API Discrepancies: Some POST API requests require parameters that are not reflected in the design. Additionally, certain text fields present in the design do not correspond to any parameters in the API body.
Arabic Response Issue: The API's Arabic responses occasionally display as strange characters. I'm not sure if this issue is unique to me.
UI Implementation: I've done my best to implement the UI as closely as possible to the reference video.

Time Spent
Total time spent: 10 hours.
